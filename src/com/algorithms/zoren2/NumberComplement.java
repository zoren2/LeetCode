 * 476. Number Complement
 * 
 * Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement
 * strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
 * 
 * Note: The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit
 * signed integer. You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary
 * representation.
